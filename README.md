## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements an Email Spam Detection system using Machine Learning techniques. The model achieves a remarkable 98% accuracy in classifying emails as spam or legitimate (ham). The implementation uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various ML algorithms to provide reliable spam detection.

## 🎯 Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
- Machine Learning model implementation
- High accuracy spam detection
- Easy-to-use interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
